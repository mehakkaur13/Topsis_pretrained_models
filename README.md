# ðŸš€ Pre-Trained Model Selection for Text Similarity using TOPSIS  

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction  
Selecting the best **pre-trained NLP model** for **sentence similarity** is crucial for various applications like search engines, chatbots, and recommendation systems. This project evaluates multiple transformer models using key performance metrics and ranks them using **TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)**.

### **Why TOPSIS?**  
TOPSIS helps in selecting the best model by considering multiple conflicting criteria, such as:  
âœ… **Higher accuracy (Cosine Similarity)**  
âœ… **Faster inference (Low latency)**  
âœ… **Lower memory and disk usage**  
âœ… **Lower Euclidean & Manhattan distances**
